_That’s me (right!) at a Japanese temple for New Year’s. That dragon is supposed to give you luck :)_

### Short version

👨‍💻 Spent two months building an app to detect trends.

🙂 Launched as a Show HN and reached #1 on Hacker News (briefly!).

📈 Another four months growing and improving.

🐦 People continued to like and tweet about the project.

🤯 Failed to monetize.

🎉 Enough traction to get acquired by Brian Dean, founder of [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/).

🕺🏼 New focus, name, and design overhaul: 👉 [ExplodingTopics.com](https://explodingtopics.com/)

### Long version

I should preface this by saying that I was tremendously lucky with how things turned out, and I’m not recommending this as a reproducible guide for anyone.

Instead, I’d like to give thanks to the people who supported the project — all those good folks on Hacker News, Indie Hackers, and even Reddit.

And personal shoutouts to [Vincent of Threader](https://threader.app/) (who convinced me to write this story!), [Adrian Love](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-love), Daniel Eckler, and my wife, Akane.

All your feedback helped to continuously improve the project, and your encouragement was great fuel in the absence of revenue.

### How it started

I began work on Trennd.co in April while living in Japan. Back then, it was called TrendList.io.

I started to realize that it’s 100 times easier to bootstrap a profitable online business if you ride a big market trend. Jump on the opportunity before the competition gets too fierce.

A great example of this is Jon and Justin at [Transistor.fm](https://saas.transistor.fm/), who spotted a growing B2B market for podcast hosting and bootstrapped a SaaS for it.

Another classic example: Pieter Levels tapped into the digital nomad and remote work trend while scratching his own itch with [Nomad List](https://levels.io/product-hunt-hacker-news-number-one/) and Remote OK.

Market awareness and market timing were both critical for these guys. On top of execution skill, of course.

But businesses also take years of sales, marketing, and general hard work even after you’ve launched. I’d like to know that life force is going into a growing opportunity, not a shrinking one.

I needed something that could surface opportunities by automatically monitoring the web for new topics so I can then plug them into Google Trends.

Heck, it could even check Google Trends itself so I don’t have to.

I needed a shiny new app or tool to play with. 😛

But I couldn’t find anything, so I started to build it for myself.

The first version was literally just a CLI tool that output trend graphs to the console.

I thought I might as well package it as a B2C SaaS product. But whoa no, not another sales grind. Especially B2C.

Let’s just put it up for free and see if I can even build an audience (basically an email list) around it first.

As I proclaimed on the about page, “Revenue is obviously at zero right now. It will likely stay there for a while. Probably forever.”

Not wanting to miss the opportunity to try a fancy new web stack, I wrapped the tool up into a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) web app. This choice was primarily to capitalize on the out-of-box server-side rendering it offers. That way, I could actually get this project to rank properly on Google for all the various trends.

I listed Trennd in early May (way before it was finished) on Product Hunt’s Ship service. Admittedly though, I probably should’ve done much more than this and actually talked to potential users/customers before writing any code.

But I was very bullish on the concept since I was building Trennd to solve my own problem. 👹
