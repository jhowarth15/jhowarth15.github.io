title: How My Startup Got Acquired After 6 Months
---

## I couldn’t find the service I needed, so I built it for myself. And that was the start.

_That’s me (right!) at a Japanese temple for New Year’s. That dragon is supposed to give you luck :)_

### Short version

👨‍💻 Spent two months building an app to detect trends.

🙂 Launched as a Show HN and reached #1 on Hacker News (briefly!).

📈 Another four months growing and improving.

🐦 People continued to like and tweet about the project.

🤯 Failed to monetize.

🎉 Enough traction to get acquired by Brian Dean, founder of [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/).

🕺🏼 New focus, name, and design overhaul: 👉 [ExplodingTopics.com](https://explodingtopics.com/)
